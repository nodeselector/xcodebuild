      Allow device registration. This can register the virtual machine hosting the
      workflow with the Apple Developer Portal. This is probably not what you want
      since it will consume a device slot and the virtual machine uuid will vary
      over time.

      The machine uuid is setable on Intel virtual machines, but unfortunately, not
      on Apple Silicon virtual machines.
